# blockchain_contracts
A Repo where we build public blockchain smart contracts with the Solidity framework.



# Tech Stack
- Solidity: Smart contracts
- Hardhat: Local development environment
- Node.js + Express: API and backend logic
- HTML + JS: Frontend simulation portal
- Ethers.js: Blockchain interaction


Smart Contracts within Repo:

## AerospaceSupplyChain - Blockchain-based Component Traceability
AerospaceSupplyChain is a smart contract system built on Ethereum to manage and track the lifecycle of aerospace components in a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof manner using blockchain. It simulates the supply chain involving Boeing (owner), Manufacturers, Labs, and Installers.

Built with Solidity, Node.js, and a sleek HTML frontend
- Smart Contract Lifecycle: Components move through Ordered → Created → Tested → Approved → Installed → ReadyForDelivery → Delivered
- Role-based Access: Ensures only authorized entities can perform specific actions
- Immutable Audit Trail: Every state change is recorded in the blockchain
- Payments: Automated payments to installers and manufacturers after successful actions
- Interactive Demo Portal: UI to simulate each role and their permitted actions
- Real-time Event Listeners: Backend listeners to capture status updates
- Single Security - Roles and validations are implemented in the contract, and no need to worry about how the other orgs are implementing their security.



Sample Demonstration of operations from multiple orgs along their wallet on one single smart contract.

Backend events are emitted, and payment is made automatically by the smart contract.

Security checked with the smart contract itself. Orgs don't have to trust their own  and other orgs' database and application security.

## Why Blockchain & Smart Contracts?
Modern businesses are built on data, trust, and transactions—yet traditional systems struggle to keep up with the need for real-time transparency, automation, and security. That’s where Blockchain and Smart Contracts shine.

### What is Blockchain?
Blockchain is a shared digital ledger that stores information across multiple systems in a way that is secure, verifiable, and immutable.

- Decentralized Trust: No need to rely on a single system or company to store the "truth."
- Tamper-proof History: Once added, data cannot be altered, creating a permanent audit trail.
- Real-time Visibility: All stakeholders see the same version of truth instantly.
- Single Source of Truth: Everyone refers to the same record, avoiding conflicting databases.

### What are Smart Contracts?
Smart contracts are programs deployed on blockchain that automatically execute actions based on predefined rules.

- Self-executing: Automatically perform actions (e.g., payments, approvals) without manual intervention.
- Immutable Logic: Once deployed, rules cannot be changed or bypassed.
- No Blind Trust: You don't need to trust the other party, softwares or their database—the contract ensures fairness.
- Transparent Rules: Everyone can see and verify the logic.
- Secure by Design: Built-in cryptographic guarantees make it extremely hard to hack or forge.
