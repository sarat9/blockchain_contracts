# blockchain_contracts
A Repo where we build public blockchain smart contracts with Solidity framework.



# Tech Stack
- Solidity: Smart contracts
- Hardhat: Local development environment
- Node.js + Express: API and backend logic
- HTML + JS: Frontend simulation portal
- Ethers.js: Blockchain interaction


Smart Contracts within Repo:

### AerospaceSupplyChain - Blockchain-based Component Traceability
AerospaceSupplyChain is a smart contract system built on Ethereum to manage and track the lifecycle of aerospace components in a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof manner using blockchain. It simulates the supply chain involving Boeing (owner), Manufacturers, Labs, and Installers.

Built with Solidity, Node.js, and a sleek HTML frontend
- Smart Contract Lifecycle: Components move through Ordered → Created → Tested → Approved → Installed → ReadyForDelivery → Delivered
- Role-based Access: Ensures only authorized entities can perform specific actions
- Immutable Audit Trail: Every state change is recorded in the blockchain
- Payments: Automated payments to installers and manufacturers after successful actions
- Interactive Demo Portal: UI to simulate each role and their permitted actions
- Real-time Event Listeners: Backend listeners to capture status updates


## Why Blockchain & Smart Contracts?
Modern businesses are built on data, trust, and transactions—yet traditional systems struggle to keep up with the need for real-time transparency, automation, and security. That’s where Blockchain and Smart Contracts shine.

### What is Blockchain?
Blockchain is a shared digital ledger that stores information across multiple systems in a way that is secure, verifiable, and immutable.

- Decentralized Trust: No need to rely on a single system or company to store the "truth."
- Tamper-proof History: Once added, data cannot be altered, creating a permanent audit trail.
- Real-time Visibility: All stakeholders see the same version of truth instantly.
- Single Source of Truth: Everyone refers to the same record, avoiding conflicting databases.

### What are Smart Contracts?
Smart contracts are programs deployed on blockchain that automatically execute actions based on predefined rules.

- Self-executing: Automatically perform actions (e.g., payments, approvals) without manual intervention.
- Immutable Logic: Once deployed, rules cannot be changed or bypassed.
- No Blind Trust: You don't need to trust the other party, softwares or their database—the contract ensures fairness.
- Transparent Rules: Everyone can see and verify the logic.
- Secure by Design: Built-in cryptographic guarantees make it extremely hard to hack or forge.
